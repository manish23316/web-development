<h3 style="text-align:center;">User Interface Design Basics</h3>
<p style="text-align:center;">User Interface (UI) Design focuses on anticipating what users might need to do and ensuring that the interface has elements that are easy to access,
understand, and use to facilitate those actions. UI brings together concepts from interaction design, visual design, and information architecture. (Well-done UI design is all about satisfying the client’s needs, when you know your audience, understand its goals and skills. The GUI should be intuitively simple, 
and the following UI rules may help to achieve that goal and make success of the website.

  <h2>Some explanation about User Interface design</h2>

  <p>If you are planning to launch a site, beforehand, you should already have an image of your target market in mind along with
 its needs and expectations. To make it easier, go ahead with a survey to find out what your audience think of the design and take their feedback into account. 
This will help to correct any possible drawbacks corresponding to your visitors’ preferences.
Make the interface simple. It means that your customers should intuitively navigate through the app or website. Simplicity can be achieved by experimenting with
 color palette and typography, using feedback messages and simplified contact forms etc.
</p>

 <p>Another good example is pictured on UserApp site where whitespace is used to highlight the essential part of the GUI which should be noticed by clients.
When common visual pattern rules are broken, the audience will stay longer on the webpage. Do not be afraid of experimenting with a tasteful and fashionable look 
to your website and get the best user interface.

Apply visual hierarchy. The most important elements on the web page should be highlighted to make the audience pay attention to them. One of the examples 
is to make the element size bigger , so it is turned into a focal point. If you open the Netflix homepage, you will see bold font which you will not be able to ignore.</p>

<div style="background-color:lightgrey;color:black;padding:20px;">
  <p>Use color and contrast settings expertly. One of the most important purposes of color is to express visual hierarchy. Color and contrast settings distinguish interface 
elements and hold the attention of your audience. An illustrative example of the use of contrasting colors can be found on the official Jurassic World Spanish site
Remember that dark colors add more visual weight, which is why they should be balanced with lighter shades.
Make forms simpler. Forms are one way of interaction between your website audience and web projects. The issue is that most people hate filling out forms.
Your task is to make the form as painless as possible which means the users will not have enough time to caught up in the process of form filling and become annoyed.
 Take Twitter. They offer a short and lovely sign up form to their visitors where only phone/email/username and password need to be provided to register.
Creating a well-structured interface is not as simple as it may seem at first sight. To succeed with usable and aesthetic UI design, you need to employ all practices together, 
to work closely with the UX team, because UX and UI go hand in hand.</p>
  
<p>Being engaged in interface design, remember these basic yet profound tips: the interface has to be easy to use, intuitive to navigate, include the right colors for the 
audience, use correct fonts, add the simplest forms to submit the information and always stay consistent. These tips will help you to produce one of the greatest UI designs!
