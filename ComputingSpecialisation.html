<p><b>Some Terms about Computing Specialisation</b></p>
</ul>

<section>
As an Computer Science student we must choose one of these predefined specializations, or a combination of any two specializations 
(dual depth). As you can see in the map at right, there is some overlap between the different specializations, 
as some courses can be applied to more than one specialization.
You’re not bound at all by the initial "interest" you list on your application, and you can switch specializations at any time. 
To do this, just complete a new program sheet and have your advisor sign it.
